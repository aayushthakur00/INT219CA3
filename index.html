        <p class="text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

        <p class="text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
            
            For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.

        <p class="text-small">According to a 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, 90% of the information transmitted to the brain is visual and human brains process visuals 60,000 times faster than they do text. This is where visual time management worksheets come in handy.

            Time management strategies are the unlikely hero. They help you spend your time wisely and efficiently. Using these strategies in conjunction with data visualization help you make sense of your work. Here are five different worksheets to help you take your work to the next level.</p>
